  <h1>DinoBlaster</h1>
  <p>A game pretending to be from 1979, <a href="http://rundino.run/">DinoBlaster</a> is about an arcadey struggle for survival as a brontosaurus. Sidestep asteroids, jump into UFOs, stay away from volcanos and stay ahead of the T-Rex. Currently in development for release in 2017.
  <p>The design of DinoBlaster pays homage to old vector classics. Its artwork imitates the crude polygons of those titles, which drew directly to the screen with a glowing beam of electrons. Lines are straight; no-fill; single-weight; and don’t self-intersect.</p>
  <p>Below is a video and some .gifs of the work in progress.</p>

  <p class="caption">The main character, left, uses the fewest lines possible. Later dinos bend the rules a little by using more&nbsp;detail.</p>

  <p class="caption">Running animation gives the illusion of legs crossing without self-intersecting. Two-frame animation stays true to 70s technology.</p>

  <p class="caption">Run animation in action. The dino leans forward, but doesn’t bob or pitch to keep it readable while it moves and rotates.</p>

  <p class="caption">Fake but fun tech constraint: Only one color possible at a time. Palette chosen from the Lab color space to ensure similar lightness across the board, which is easier on the eyes. (Including a dark hue like blue would make the UFO seem to flicker).</p>

  <p class="caption">Animations drawn frame-by-frame in Illustrator, then exported into sprite sheets, a good format for web designers and 2D artists.</p>

  <p class="caption">App icon. Vector style plus a little Atari box-art nostalgia. Readable and contrasty at tiny physical sizes and against many backgrounds.</p>

  <p class="caption">The minimal logo explains the concept with great economy and uses the charismatic T-Rex.</p>
